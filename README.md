# MATLAB-code-for-BPSK-
This repository contains MATLAB code for  BPSK Modulation scheme. The code is written at baseband level without using inbuilt commands.
Bit Error is plotted for different levels of signal to noise Ratio
Theoretical Bit Error and simulated BER plots are plotted on a single graph.
The two plots lie close to each other which means the simulation done is correct.
